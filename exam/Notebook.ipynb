    "- **Git and version control** for project management\n",

    "\n",
    "I prefer working in a *distraction-free environment* where I can concentrate deeply. A **comfortable desk setup** with proper mouse and keyboard is essential, as it allows me to focus on solving problems rather than physical discomfort. Additionally, good lighting and a coffee nearby help maintain my *productivity* throughout longer coding sessions. When I combine these elements, I find myself most capable of producing **clean, efficient code** and debugging effectively."
